It can also **store different types of data through arrays that can contain geospatial imagery, rasters, terrain data, climate data, and text**.

This flexibility is nice, however, similar to hdf5 data formats, it can be challenging when communities make different decisions about how and where they store data in a netCDF file. The netCDF4 data standard is used broadly by the climate science community to store climate data. Climate data are:\n",
