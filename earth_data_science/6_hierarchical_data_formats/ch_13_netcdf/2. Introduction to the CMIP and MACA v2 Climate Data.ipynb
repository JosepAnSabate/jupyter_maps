    "The Climate Model Intercomparison Project, better known as CMIP, is a framework for analyzing and comparing Global Climate Models (GCMs) to better understand climate change occuring now and into the future. GCMs are a type of climate models that simulate the global and regional scale climate processes that include the general circulation of atmosphere and oceans and its interaction with the land, radiative fluxes, cloud processes, and land surface processes that include hydrology and biological feedbacks. CMIP5, phase 5 of the project, is the current and most extensive CMIP, drawing data from over 40 GCMs from countries around the world."

    "Downscaling allows us to have future climate projections available at a much finer spatial scale and more representative of a regionâ€™s climate and therefore more applicable for regional-scale applications. For example, it is more appropriate for discerning projected hydrological changes at a watershed scale as opposed to taking those projections directly from a GCM output. Overall, downscaling makes the data more useful on a local and regional level, which is important because adaptation strategies are generally identified and implemented on regional and local scales. This allows resource managers to identify vulnerable areas and prioritize adaptation efforts there."

There are many different processing and statistical approaches that can be used to downscale GCM data, each of which produce different levels and types of uncertainty.
