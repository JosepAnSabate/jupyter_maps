    "## Uncertainty\n",
    "Uncertainty: Uncertainty quantifies the range of values within which the value of the measure falls within - within a specified level of confidence. The uncertainty quantitatively indicates the “quality” of your measurement. It answers the question: “how well does the result represent the value of the quantity being measured?”\n",

    "##  Measurement Accuracy\n",
    "Measurement **accuracy is a concept that relates to whether there is bias in measurements**, i.e. whether the expected value of our observations is close to the true value. For low accuracy measurements, we may collect many observations, and the mean of those observations may not provide a good measure of the truth (e.g., the height of the tree). For high accuracy measurements, the mean of many observations would provide a good measure of the true value. This is different from **precision, which typically refers to the variation among observations.** "

    "    \n",
    "**Random Error: is a component of the total error which, in the course of a number of measurements, varies in an unpredictable way.** It is not possible to correct for random error. Random errors can occur for a variety of reasons such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lack of equipment sensitivity. An instrument may not be able to respond to or indicate a change in some quantity that is too small or the observer may not be able to discern the change.\n",
    "- Noise in the measurement. Noise is extraneous disturbances that are unpredictable or random and cannot be completely accounted for.\n",
    "- Imprecise definition. It is difficult to exactly define the dimensions of a object. For example, it is difficult to determine the ends of a crack with measuring its length. Two people may likely pick two different starting and ending points.    "

    "Lidar data can be used estimate tree height because it is an efficient way to measure large areas of trees (forests) quantitatively. However, you can process the lidar data in many different ways to estimate height. Which method most closely represents the actual heights of the trees on the ground?"

We then extract the raster cell values for each circle and calculate the max value for all of the pixels that fall within the plot area.\n",
