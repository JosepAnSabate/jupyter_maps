    "- Hashtags: Always proceeded by a # symbol. A hashtag is often describes a particular event or can be related to a particular topic. It is a way for users to communicate with a particular group of people on twitter - for instance those attending a conference #agu2016 or those using r #rstats.\n",
    "- Links: Links can be embedded within a tweet. Links are a way that users share information.\n",

    "- Replies: When someone posts a tweet, another user can reply directly to that user - similar to a text message except the message is visible to the public.\n",
    "- Retweets: a retweet is when someone shares a tweet with their followers.\n",
    "- Favorites: You can “like” a tweet to keep a history of content that you like in your account.\n",
