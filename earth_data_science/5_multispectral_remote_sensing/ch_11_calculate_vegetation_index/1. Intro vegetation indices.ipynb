Thus this index can be used with both Landsat 8, MODIS and other multi (and hyper) spectral sensors."

    "## Difference NBR\n",
    "The Normalized Burn Ratio is most powerful as a tool to better understand fire extent and severity when used after calculating the difference between pre and post fire conditions. This difference is best measured using data collected immediately before the fire and then immediately after the fire. NBR is less effective if time has passed and vegetation regrowth / regeneration has begun after the fire. Once vegetation regeneration has begun, the fire scar will begin to reflect a stronger signal in the NIR portion of the spectrum because healthy plants reflect strongly in the NIR portion due to the properties of chlorophyll).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the NBR ratio works better in areas like the United States where plant regeneration is expected to occur more slowly. In areas like the tropics which are wet and characterized by rapid regrowth, NBR may be less effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the difference NBR, you subtract the post-fire NBR raster from the pre-fire NBR raster as follows:"

    "The NBR index can be a powerful tool to identify pixels that have a high likelyhood or being “burned”. However it is important to know that this index is also sensitive to water and thus sometimes, pixels that are classified as “high severity” may actually be water. Because of this, it is important to mask out areas of water PRIOR to performing any quantitative analysis on the difference NBR results."
