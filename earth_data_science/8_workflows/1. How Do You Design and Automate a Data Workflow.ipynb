    "Changes in seasonality can be important indicators of ecological change. For example, if green-up begins earlier, such that fruit or seed resources become available sooner than average, animals that forage on the fruits in the spring must either migrate earlier to use these resources, or miss out on them if they do not adjust migration behavior. This phenomenon is referred to as a phenological mismatch."
